/**
 * Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of
 * vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the
 * ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not
 * a DAG. This is because for TS there must be 1. At least one node that has in
 * order of 0 i.e. no nodes are directed towards it. 2. There must be at least
 * one node that has out order of 0 i.e. it does not direct to any other node.
